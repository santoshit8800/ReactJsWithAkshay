Assignment 8 Questions
Ques1. How do you create nested routes using react router dom configuration?
Ans. For making nested routes, you need to provide path object in the children of the children as relative path like below:

const appRouter = createBrowserRouter([
    {
        path: "/",
        element: <AppLayout />,
        errorElement: <ErrorComponent />,
        children: [
            {
                path: '/about',
                element: <About />,
                children: [
                    {
                        path: 'profile',
                        element: <Profile />
                    }
                ]
            },
        ]
    }
]);
Now, you can access the routes on /about/profile -> you will get Profile component rendering in the outlet of About component.

Ques2. What is createHashRouter and createMemoryRouter?
Ans. createHashRouter: This router is useful if you are unable to configure your web server to direct all traffic to your React Router application. Instead of using normal URLs, it will use the hash (#) portion of the URL to manage the "application URL". Note: Using hash URLs is not recommended.

createMemoryRouter: Instead of using the browsers history a memory router manages it's own history stack in memory. It's primarily useful for testing and component development tools like Storybook, but can also be used for running React Router in any non-browser environment.

const router = createMemoryRouter(routes, {
    initialEntries: ["/", "/events/123"],
    initialIndex: 1,
  });
Type Definition:

function createMemoryRouter(
  routes: RouteObject[],
  opts?: {
    basename?: string;
    initialEntries?: InitialEntry[];
    initialIndex?: number;
    window?: Window;
  }
): RemixRouter;
Ques3. What is the order of lifecycle method in Class Based component
Ans. It follows the below order:

When only single component:
--------------- Render Phase

Constructor
Render
--------------- Commit Phase

ComponentDidMount
Re-render if any state change
ComponentDidUpdate
Re-render if any state change
ComponentWillUnmount
When Parent Child component are present:
--------------- Render Phase

Parent constructor
Parent render
Child constructor
Child render
--------------- Commit Phase

Child componentDidMount
Parent componentDidMount
When Multiple Child component are present:
--------------- Render Phase

Parent constructor
Parent render
Child constructor 1
Child render 1
Child constructor 2
Child render 2
--------------- Commit Phase

Child componentDidMount 1
Child componentDidMount 2
Parent componentDidMount
Because above react want to finish the render phase for all the children so after child render 1 it will show child constructor 2/

When Parent Child component are present where child having api call as well:
--------------- Render Phase

Parent constructor
Parent render
Child constructor
Child render
--------------- Commit Phase

Parent componentDidMount
Child componentDidMount
Child re renders
why this happens because child have an api call and it needs to fetch the data and update DOM, where fetching is asynchronous

Ques4. Why do we use componentDidMount?
Ans. componentDidMount gets called after the first render in the react lifecycle and hence its becomes perfect place to call or fetch data from API

Ques5. Why do we use componentWillUnmount?
Ans. componentWillUnmount gets called just before the component getting unmounted or removed from the DOM. It can be useful for clearing up the data similar to how we used to clear the setInterval in the Profile component.

Ques6. Why do we use super(props) in constructor?
Ans. super() will call the constructor of its parent class. This is required when you need to access some variables from the parent class. In React, when you call super with props, React will make props available across the component through this.props. This is how our custom component gets props variable inherited from React.Component which we are extending from React library.

Ques7. Why should we don't have the callback function of useEffect async?
Ans. Reactâ€™s useEffect hook expects a cleanup function returned from it which is called when the component unmounts. Using an async function here will cause a bug as the cleanup function will never get called.

Instead, you should use either immediately invoked functions or named function in such scenarios IIF

useEffect(() => {
  (async () => {
    const users = await fetchUsers();
    setUsers(users);
  })();
    return () => {
        // this now gets called when the component unmounts
    };
}, []);
Named function

useEffect(() => {
  const getUsers = async () => {
    const users = await fetchUsers();
    setUsers(users);
  };

  getUsers();

  return () => {
    // this now gets called when the component unmounts
  };
}, []);
