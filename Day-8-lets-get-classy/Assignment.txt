4. What is SPA?
A single page application is a website or web application that dynamically rewrites a 
current web page with new data from the web server, instead of the default method of 
a web browser loading entire new pages.
5. What is difference between Client Side Routing and Server Side Routing?
Server Side Routing Client Side routing
Server side routing is not part of React 
Router but it is still the most common 
form of handling routes. 
With server side routing, a user clicks a 
link that requests a new page or new 
data from the server (another computer). 
And then new data or document is 
served to the user.
The reason client side routing has 
become something more developers 
have been considering when creating 
their apps is due to the popularity of 
creating single page applications 
(SPAs). 
With a SPA, when a user clicks on an 
internal link within your application, the 
goal would be to see a change in the url 
bar to show that there is an update 
happening to the page without a full 
page refresh.
